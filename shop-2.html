        <div class="desc">A movie theater (American English),[1] cinema (British English),[2] or cinema hall (Indian English),[3] also known as a picture house, the pictures, picture theatre, or the movies, is a building that contains auditoria for viewing films (also called movies) for entertainment. Most, but not all, theaters are commercial operations catering to the general public, who attend by purchasing a ticket. Some movie theaters, however, are operated by non-profit organizations or societies that charge members a membership fee to view films.</div>
